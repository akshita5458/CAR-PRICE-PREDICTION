# Car Price Prediction

This project implements a car price prediction model using Linear Regression Model. The goal is to predict the price of a car based on various features such as the carâ€™s brand, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, owner type, mileage, engine capacity, max power, and the number of seats.

# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains a project for predicting car prices using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained using a dataset of car details and deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The model is saved and loaded using `pickle` for persistence.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: Exploration and visualization of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for training the model.
3. **Model Training**: Using Linear Regression to train the model on the cleaned dataset.
4. **Model Persistence**: Saving the trained model using `pickle` for later use.
5. **Web Development**: Developing a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the interface easily.

pre-requisite - install vs code or python

Libraries used - sklearn,numpy,pandas,streamlit,pickle

Run the jupyter notebook in vs code there you will save the model using pickle and that will be imported in main script app.py , run app.py with given code then write in terminal Streamlit run app.py .There you you will preview the project(car price predictor).
